    """
    DataFix shift detection and corrupt feature localization using a supervised
    learning estimator that acts as a discriminator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : ``Estimator`` instance, default=RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0)
        A supervised learning classifier with a ``fit`` method that provides
        information about feature importance through a ``coef_`` attribute or a
        ``feature_importances_`` attribute. The default estimator is
        `RandomForestClassifier` with a random state of 0.
    cv : None, int, str, or an iterable, default=5
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for ``cv`` are:
        - None, to use the default single stratified train/test split
        :class:`StratifiedShuffleSplit`, with ``n_splits`` = 1, and
        ``test_size`` = ``test_size``.
        - int, to specify the number of folds of stratified K-fold
          cross-validation :class:`StratifiedKFold`.
        - An iterable with ``split`` method yielding (train, test) splits as
        arrays of indexes.
    test_size : float or int, default=0.2
        Useful only when ``cv`` is None. If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0
        and represent the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split.
        If int, represents the absolute number of test samples.
    scoring : str or list, default='balanced_accuracy'.
        It specifies the metric(s) to evaluate the performance of the estimator. 
        The supported metrics can be found in `sklearn.metrics` or alternatively, 
        it can be one of the following:
        - ``D1``: log(p1) + log(1-p0).
        - ``D2``: log(p1 / p0).
        - ``D3``: -log((1/p0) - 1).
    n_jobs : int, default=-1
        Number of jobs to run in parallel. None means 1, unless in a
        joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors.
    return_estimator : bool, default=False
        Whether to return the estimators fitted on each split and iteration.
    step : None, int or float, default=None
        If greater than or equal to 1, then step corresponds to the (integer)
        number of features to remove at each iteration. If within (0.0, 1.0),
        then step corresponds to the percentage (rounded down) of features to
        remove at each iteration, based on the number of remaining features.
        Note that the last iteration may remove fewer than step features in order
        to reach ``max_features_to_filter``. None means there is no limit in the
        (integer) number of features removed in each iteration.
    percentage : None or float, default=0.1.
        To determine the maximum percentage of the total feature importances
        that can be removed at each iteration. The removal percentage is
        calculated as the specified percentage multiplied by
        `2·[balanced_accuracy_(t) - 0.5]`, where balanced_accuracy_(t) is the
        balanced accuracy of the estimator at iteration t. At a maximum, when
        the balanced accuracy is 1.0, the specified percentage of the total
        importances is removed. At a minimum, when the balanced accuracy is 0.5
        or lower, only a single feature is removed. None means there is no limit
        in the percentage of the total importances removed at each iteration.
    alpha : None, int or float, default=1
        Used to define a threshold at ``alpha``/``n_features_t``, with
        ``alpha`` ≥ 1 and ``n_features_t`` being the number of features at
        iteration t. Only features with importance over the threshold are removed.
        The threshold adjusts dynamically based on the number of available
        features at each iteration. None means that the minimum feature
        importance of a feature to be removed needs to be above 0.
    threshold : None, int or float, default=None
        Only features with importance over the threshold are removed. Unlike
        ``alpha``, the threshold is static. None means that the minimum feature
        importance of a feature to be removed needs to be above 0.
    margin : None or float, default=0.01
        Stop condition based on balanced accuracy being less than 0.5 + ``margin``.
        None means balanced accuracy is not used as a stop condition, except
        if ``patience`` is not None.
    max_features_to_filter : None, int or float, default=None
        If greater than or equal to 1, then max_features_to_filter corresponds
        to the maximum (integer) number of features to remove in total. If within
        (0.0, 1.0), then max_features_to_filter corresponds to the percentage
        (rounded down) of maximum features to remove in total. None means there
        is no limit in the maximum (integer) number of features to remove in
        total.
    max_it : None or int, default=None
        Maximum number of iterations. None means there is no limit in the
        number of iterations.
    patience : None or int, default=None
        Maximum number of iterations without improvement in balanced accuracy.
        None means balanced accuracy is not used as a stop condition, except
        if ``margin`` is not None.
    random_state : None or int, default=0
        Controls randomness by passing an integer for reproducible output.
    find_best : None or 'knee-balanced', default='knee-balanced'
        If 'knee-balanced', the optimal number of features to eliminate is
        determined by finding the knee of the curve representing the balanced
        accuracy of the estimator vs the number of removed features. None means
        the algorithm does not search for the optimal iteration; instead, it 
        returns the last iteration as the optimal one.
    window_length : None or int, default=2
        Useful only when ``find_best`` == 'knee-balanced'. Used to determine the
        length of the filter window for Savitzky-Golay filter. The window length
        is computed as: `max(5, (delta*window_length)//2*2+1)`, where delta is
        the mean distance between ``corrupted_features_`` points.
    polyorder : None or int, default=4
        Useful only when ``find_best`` == 'knee-balanced'. The polyorder used to
        fit the samples for Savitzky-Golay filter.
    S : None or int, default=5
        Useful only when ``find_best`` == 'knee-balanced'. Sensitity for knee
        location. It is a measure of how many “flat” points are expected in
        the unmodified data curve before declaring a knee.  If the algorithm
        fails to detect a knee point, the sensitivity is gradually decreased
        until a solution is found. If no solution is found with the minimum
        sensitivity of 1, then the last iteration is considered the knee point.
    online : None or bool, default=False
        Useful only when ``find_best`` == 'knee-balanced'. When set to True, it
        "corrects" old knee values if necessary.
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbosity.
